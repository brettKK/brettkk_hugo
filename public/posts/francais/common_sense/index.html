<blockquote>
<p>Slade this is such a crock of shit
Slade you are in the Barrett school not a barracks
wthat is your motto here
boys inform on you classmates, save your hide anything short of that we're going to burn you at the stake
wow gentlemen
when the shit hits the fan some guys and some guys stay
his charlie, facing the fire and as George hiding in Big Daddy's pocket and
what are you doing? you'are going to reward George and destroy charlie
are you finished mr.Sladee
no i'm just getting warmed up!
I don't know who went to this place
William Howard Taft, Willian Jennings Brayan, Willian Tell whoever
their spirit is dead if they have a had one it's gone
you're building a rat ship here, a vessel for seagoing snitches and if you think
you're preparing these minnows for manhood you better think again because i say you're
killing the very spirit this institution proclaims it instills</p>

<p>what i share what kind of a show you guys putting on here today
I mean the only class in this act is sitting next to me and i'm here to tell you this
boy's soul is intact. It's non-negotiable. you know how i know
some here and i'm not going to say who offered to buy it, noly Charlie here wasnt selling</p>

<p>Sir you're out of order
I don't . I show you on order
you don't know without all it is mr.Trask.
I'd show you but I'm too old, I'm too tired, I'm too fucking blind.
if I was a man i was five years ago, I take a flamethrower to this place
I don't konw who the hell you think you're talking to/</p>

<p>I've been around you know
there was a time I could see and I have seen boys like these younger than these
their arms torn out, their legs ripped off but there is nothing like a sight fo an
amputated spirit. there is no prosthetic for that. you think you're merely sending his splendid
foot soldier back home the Argonne with his tail between his legs
buts I say you are executing his soul and why, because he's not a bad man, bad men
you hurt this boy, you're going to be bad bums, delaria
and hairy Jimmy Trent wherever you are there, fuck you too.</p>

<p>stand down mr.Slade ..... I'm not finished as I came in here . I heared those words.
cradle a leadership
wel when the bough breaks, the cradle will fall and it has fallen here. It has fallen make us
a man. creators or leaders be careful what kind of leads you're producing here.
I don't know if Charlie's silence here today is right or wrong.
I'm not a judge or jury but i can tell you this he won't sell anybody out to buy his future and
that my friends is called integrity, that's called courage. now  that's the stuff leads should be
made of.</p>

<p>now i have come to the cross roads in my life
I always knew what the right path was without exception i knew, but i nerver took it you know why?
it was too damn hard
now here's Charlie he's come to the crossroads. he has chosen a path it's the right path
it'a path made a principle that leads to character. Let him continue on his journey.
you hold this boy's future in your hands committee.
It's a valuable future. Believe me, don't destory it, protect it, embrace it.
it's going to make you proud one day, I promise you!</p>
